**Q1**:What are Side Effects ? 

**Solution**:

As we build applications, we often need to synchronize with external systems. This can include things like:

- Making network requests
- Managing timeouts / intervals
- Reading/writing from localStorage
- Listening for global events

React calls all of these things “side effects”
