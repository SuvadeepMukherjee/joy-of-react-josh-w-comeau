**Q1**:What are React Hooks ? 

**Solution:**

- Hooks  **allow us to package up and re-use business logic**.Like how a `Button` component can be sprinkled around our application, we can create custom bundles of business logic, like `useMousePosition` or `useSpringAnimation`, which can be shared between components.

**Q2**:Why did the React team came up with Hooks ? 

**Solution**:

Earlier components were the only tool in the toolbox.Every problem in React was solved with components . non-UI usecases led to a common scenario called **Wrapper Hell** 

In order to help with these issues , the React team developed a second tool for the toolbox : **Hooks**
