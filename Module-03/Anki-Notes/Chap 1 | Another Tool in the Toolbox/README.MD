**Q1**:What are React Hooks ? 

**Solution:**

- Hooks  allow us to package up and re-use business logic.Like how a `Button` component can be sprinkled around our application, we can create custom bundles of business logic, like `useMousePosition` or `useSpringAnimation`, which can be shared between components.
- Hooks are special functions that allow us to hook into React internals
