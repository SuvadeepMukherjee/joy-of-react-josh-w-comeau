**Q1**:What are React Hooks ? 

**Solution:**

- Hooks  **allow us to package up and re-use business logic**.Like how a `Button` component can be sprinkled around our application, we can create custom bundles of business logic, like `useMousePosition` or `useSpringAnimation`, which can be shared between components.

**Q2**:Why did the React team came up with Hooks ? 

**Solution**:

The React team introduced **hooks** because, before them, components were the only way to handle both UI and non-UI logic. This led to messy patterns like **render props** and **wrapper hell**, where everything had to be done through components. Hooks solved this by giving developers a **new tool to reuse and share business logic**
