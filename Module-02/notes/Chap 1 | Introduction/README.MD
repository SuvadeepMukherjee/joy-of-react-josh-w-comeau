- In the early days of the web, websites were essentially fancy documents. We'd load one HTML file, read the content, and then load another one.
- The beautiful, amazing, magical thing about the modern web is that web applications are *interactive*. The app can respond to user actions in real-time, without needing to fetch a whole new page.
- React has a really novel approach towards managing this interactivity. And once you get used to it, it's really hard to imagine managing it any other way.
